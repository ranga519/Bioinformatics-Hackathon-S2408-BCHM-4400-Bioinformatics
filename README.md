# What is Cystic Fibrosis?
Cystic Fibrosis is a genetic condition that mainly affects the respiratory, digestive, and reproduction systems by causing the production of thick, sticky mucus that can obstruct various organs.
* Symptoms include 
```
* Affecting the respiratory track with: persistent coughing with thick mucus, wheezing, shortness of breath, and reccurring lung infections
* Affecting the digestive system with: Poor weight gain and growth, severe constipatuion with greasy, bulky stools, and intestinal blockages in newborns
* Affecting the reproductive system with: male infertility and decreased fertility in females
* As well as: fatigue and clubbing of fingers and toes
```
* Diagnostic methods include: 
```
* Newborn Screening
* Sweat Chloride Test
* Genetic Testing and clinical evaluation
* Pulmonary Function Test
* Chest X-rays and CT scan and sputum culture
```
There is currently no cure for Cystic Fibrosis, only treatments to manage symptoms. Treatments depend on the severity of the disease and symptoms already present.
These treatments include:
* For more minimal symptoms like infections and mucus build up: antibiotics (inhaled, oral, and intravenous), diet changes, and physical therapy can be used. 
* More serious symptoms may require surgery and in extreme cases lung transplants.
* Recently, gene therapy has been used in treatments, however with current technologies and limited resources the effectiveness has not shown a breakthrough yet.

# The Genetics of Cystic Fibrosis
The primary gene involved is the **CFTR** gene. Other genes include: SLC26A9, EDNRA, IFRD1, MBL2, TGFÎ²1
Key points about the CFTR gene:
* Over 2,000 mutations have been identified in the CFTR gene.
* The most common mutation is F508del, a deletion of phenylalanine at position 508.
* Different mutations can lead to various levels of CFTR protein dysfunction, resulting in a spectrum of disease severity.

Modifier Genes:
* While CFTR mutations are the primary cause of CF, the severity and progression of the disease can be influenced by other genes, known as modifier genes 5.

Normal Molecular Functions of CFTR gene:
* The primary function of CFTR is to act as a cAMP-regulated chloride channel. It allows the passage of chloride ions across epithelial cell membranes, which is crucial for maintaining proper salt and water balance in various organs, particularly in the lungs, pancreas, and sweat glands. 
* Other functions include channel gating, regulation of other ion channels, bicarbonate transport, Cellular Homeostasis, Epithelial Fluid Secretion, other protein interactions, innate defenses, and some developmental roles.

# Genetic Mechanism Hypothesis
Cystic Fibrosis is caused by disregulation of mucus associated genes in the lungs.
